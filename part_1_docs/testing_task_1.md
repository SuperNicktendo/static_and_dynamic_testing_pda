### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
  # Line 21, '=' should be '=='
  # Line 23, missing ':'
   
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
# Line 28, 'dif' syntax error
# Line 28, missing comma
# Line 29, indentation error
# Line 30, 'card' undefined
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
# Line 40, indentation error
# Line 41, 'total' is undefined variable
# Line 44, concactenation error
```
